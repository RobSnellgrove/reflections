When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- collaborating with others
- working away from your own computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- When collaborating, someone else may make a change and you want a local stable version before merging others' changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks are clones made on GitHub, enabling you to have your own copy of someone else's repository
- clones are copies of a repository made locally
- branches can occur both on GitHub and locally, and are developments of a repository in different directions, for example for trying out experimental features. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- So you can anticipate any conflicts before pushing and merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- using Dropbox
- it would automatically update files, but it wouldn't be clear which version related to which logical change
- you could get conflicts when two people are working on the same file
