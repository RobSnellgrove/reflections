How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- the working directory is a normal folder
- the staging area is a git concept that stores things you are choosing to add to your respository
- the respository is files that are being tracked by git

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- add the file to the staging area after the change has been made

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- When trying out experimental new features
- testing the experiment won't damage what you're trying to do on the main branch. Can return to the point before the experiment, and still retain the experiment
- master branch is your production quality branch that always works
- could also have a development branch where work is actively happening
- experimental branches, things you expect will break

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- you can see how different commits follow on from which previous commits
